**--epochs:** 

This parameter specifies the number of training iterations or passes over the entire dataset. More epochs allow the model to learn for a longer period, which can improve training but may lead to overfitting if set too high.

**--number-of-clauses:**

This sets the number of clauses used by the Tsetlin machine. Clauses are fundamental units in Tsetlin logic that form patterns. More clauses can increase the model's complexity and ability to capture intricate data relationships but may also require more computational resources and lead to overfitting if too many are used.

**--T** 

This is the threshold for the Tsetlin machine. It determines how strict the model is when accepting patterns as true. A higher T value results in more selective pattern recognition, which can improve generalization but might reduce sensitivity to some patterns.

**--s:**

The s parameter controls the specificity of the clauses. It affects the probability distribution used for updating the model during training. A higher value of s means the clauses are more specific, focusing on more detailed features of the data.

**--depth:**

This indicates the depth of the neural network or hierarchical model structure. A greater depth can increase the model's ability to learn complex representations, but it may also lead to increased training time and the potential for overfitting.

**--hypervector-size:** 

Specifies the size of the hypervectors used in the model. Hypervectors represent data in a high-dimensional space, and a larger size can potentially capture more information but will require more memory and processing power.

**--hypervector-bits:** 

Defines the number of bits used in each hypervector. This affects how data is encoded in the high-dimensional space and can impact the model's capacity and accuracy.

**--message-size:** 

The size of the message vectors used for communication within the model. This parameter can impact how efficiently data is transmitted within the model's architecture.

**--message-bits:** 

Specifies the number of bits in each message vector. A higher number of bits can allow for more detailed data representation but will require more resources.

**--double-hashing:**

A boolean flag (activated with --double-hashing) that, when enabled, uses a double hashing mechanism for certain operations in the model. This can improve performance in specific cases by reducing the risk of hash collisions.

**--max-included-literals:** 

This parameter sets the maximum number of literals (basic logical units) included in each clause. Limiting the number of literals can simplify clauses and reduce overfitting by preventing overly complex patterns.
