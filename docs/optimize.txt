Number of Clauses (number_of_clauses): 
    Controls the model complexity. Too few clauses might lead to underfitting, while too many can cause overfitting.

Threshold (T): 
    Regulates the voting threshold for accepting a clause as true. 
    A higher threshold requires more clauses to agree on a prediction.

Learning Rate (s): 
    Governs how fast the model learns. Lower values make the model learn slowly, while higher values increase the 
    learning speed but may lead to unstable training.

Max Included Literals (max_included_literals): 
    Limits the maximum number of literals that can be used by a clause. 
    This parameter controls how complex individual clauses can become.


1. Accuracy:
    Accuracy is the most intuitive metric. It tells you how often your classifier is correct.
2. Precision:
    Precision answers the question: Of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?
3. Recall:
    Recall answers the question: Of all the actual positives, how many did the model correctly identify?

4. F1 Score:
    The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 
    It balances the two metrics into a single number, providing a more comprehensive evaluation, 
    especially when you have an imbalanced dataset.
